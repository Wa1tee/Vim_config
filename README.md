My configuration and plugins for Vim8

Either add a dummy .vimrc file to your home directory with the line
```
source ~/.vim/.vimrc
```
or copy the .vimrc file itself to your home directory.
In addition change the name of this directory to either .vim or vimfiles for GNU/Linux or Windows systems respectively
